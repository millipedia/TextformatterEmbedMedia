# TextformatterEmbedMedia

A simple extension of [Teppo's](https://github.com/teppokoivula) Audio embed [Textformatter](https://github.com/teppokoivula/TextformatterAudioEmbed) that includes video as well.

We just match either a video (mp4) or audio file (mp3 / ogg / wav) wrapped in a paragraph tag and write that value into an HMTL5 video or audio tag. Nothing fancy going on.

Seems to work fine with our [TextFormatterLiteVideoEmbed](https://github.com/millipedia/TextformatterLiteVideoEmbed) if you do want fancier embeds.
